# Starter App with Create React App

This project was made in my React Mastery course from the organisation and instructors "Zero To Mastery" (ZTM).

It showcases my abilities to not only write easier functional components, but also class components with their lifecycle methods.
It has a basic search field which searches strings in the titles of the cards. You can search for names of different persons = monsters that are displayed in cards in a  grid.

## Set-up Scripts (for now)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
